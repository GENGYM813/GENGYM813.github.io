I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Peking University Stomatology Hospital](https://ss.bjmu.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhou Yongsheng](https://ss.bjmu.edu.cn/Html/Doctors/Main/Index_353.html). My research interests include the construction of various nanodrug delivery systems, their application in oral diseases, and related mechanisms of autophagy and ferroptosis.
